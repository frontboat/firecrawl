Personal and organization-owned devices can be enrolled in Intune. Once enrolled, they receive the policies and profiles you create. You have the following options when enrolling Android devices:

- [BYOD: Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-android#byod-android-enterprise-personally-owned-devices-with-a-work-profile)
- [Android Enterprise corporate owned dedicated devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-android#android-enterprise-dedicated-devices) (COSU)
- [Android Enterprise corporate owned fully managed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-android#android-enterprise-fully-managed) (COBO)
- [Android Enterprise corporate owned work profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-android#android-enterprise-corporate-owned-work-profile) (COPE)
- [Android Open Source Project (AOSP)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-android#android-open-source-project-aosp)
- [Android device administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-android#android-device-administrator) (DA)

This article provides enrollment recommendations and includes an overview of the administrator and user tasks for each option.

There's also a visual guide of the different enrollment options for each platform:

## Before you begin

For a list of all the Intune-specific prerequisites and configurations needed to prepare your tenant for enrollment, go to [Enrollment guide: Microsoft Intune enrollment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment).

Note

After you create an enrollment profile and assign it to users or groups, don't rename the enrollment profile. It can prevent future enrollments. If you need to change the name of the enrollment profile, then:

1. Create a new enrollment profile with the new name
2. Assign the new profile to the your users & devices
3. Delete the old profile

For more specific information, go to enrollment for [AOSP corporate-owned userless devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/enrollment/android-aosp-corporate-owned-userless-enroll) and [AOSP corporate-owned user-associated devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/enrollment/android-aosp-corporate-owned-user-associated-enroll).

- Be sure your devices are [supported](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/supported-devices-browsers).

- Factory reset the devices. This step is required. New devices might not require a factory reset.

- Create an enrollment profile in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), and have your device groups ready. For the specific steps, go to:

  - [AOSP corporate-owned userless devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/enrollment/android-aosp-corporate-owned-userless-enroll)
  - [AOSP corporate-owned user-associated devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/enrollment/android-aosp-corporate-owned-user-associated-enroll)
- Enroll the devices in Intune. For the specific steps, go to:


  - [AOSP corporate-owned userless devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/enrollment/android-aosp-corporate-owned-userless-enroll)
  - [AOSP corporate-owned user-associated devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/enrollment/android-aosp-corporate-owned-user-associated-enroll)

During enrollment, the Microsoft Intune app and Microsoft Authenticator app automatically install and open on the device, which allows the device to enroll. The device is locked in the enrollment process until enrollment completes.

### End user tasks (AOSP)

The specific steps depend on how you configured the enrollment profile.

Admins can complete the enrollment themselves, and then give the devices to the users. Or, users can enroll the devices using the following steps:

1. Users turn on the device, and are prompted for information, including the enrollment method: QR Code. If you created a user-associated devices enrollment profile, then they might be asked to sign in with their organization credentials ( `user@contoso.com`).

2. If you created a userless devices enrollment profile, then wait for the enrollment wizard to complete. When it does, the device is ready to use.

If you created a user-associated devices enrollment profile, then users enter the required information. Then, wait for the enrollment wizard to complete. For more specific steps, go to [enroll the device](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/user-help/enroll-device-android-microsoft-intune-app).


Users typically don't like enrolling themselves, and may not be familiar with the Company Portal app. Be sure to provide guidance, including what information to enter. For some guidance on communicating with your users, see [Planning guide: Step 5 - Create a rollout plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/intune-planning-guide#step-5---create-a-rollout-plan).

## Android device administrator

Important

Android device administrator management is deprecated and no longer available for devices with access to Google Mobile Services (GMS). If you currently use device administrator management, we recommend switching to another Android management option. Support and help documentation remain available for some devices without GMS, running Android 15 and earlier. For more information, see [Ending support for Android device administrator on GMS devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/microsoft-intune-ending-support-for-android-device-administrator/ba-p/3915443).

These Android devices are corporate, or personal/BYOD (bring your own device) devices that can access organization email, apps, and other data.

[Google deprecated Android device administrator management](https://blog.google/products/android-enterprise/da-migration/) in 2020. Intune is ending support for device administrator devices with access to Google Mobile Services in August 2024.

Microsoft recommends:

- Don't enroll new devices using Android device administrator.

- Enroll new devices using one of the other methods described in this article and/or using [App protection policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/apps/app-protection-policy).

- Move existing Android device administrator devices to one of the other methods described in this article. If you're moving them to [Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-android#byod-android-enterprise-personally-owned-devices-with-a-work-profile) (in this article), consider using the streamlined flow to move [Android devices from device administrator to personally owned work profile management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/enrollment/android-move-device-admin-work-profile).

- Create a device enrollment restriction to block device administrator enrollment. Android devices can try to enroll using device administrator before trying other enrollment methods. So, create the restriction to prevent this behavior. For more information, go to [Set enrollment restrictions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/enrollment/enrollment-restrictions-set).
